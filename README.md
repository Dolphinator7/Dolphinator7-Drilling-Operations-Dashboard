# Drilling Operations Anomaly Detection Dashboard

## Power BI Dashboard for Drilling Data Analysis and Anomaly Detection 
This project focuses on analyzing synthetic well log data to detect anomalies in drilling operations, such as drops in Rate of Penetration (ROP) and spikes in Torque. By visualizing key drilling metrics, this dashboard provides actionable insights to optimize performance and enhance well integrity.

🔍 Project Overview Objective: To build a Power BI dashboard that identifies and highlights critical anomalies in drilling operations. Data Source: Synthetic dataset containing well log measurements such as depth, Rate of Penetration (ROP), Torque, Mud Weight, and Pump Pressure. Key Insights: Early detection of anomalies can help mitigate risks, prevent equipment failure, and optimize drilling efficiency.

📊 Dashboard Features Real-time anomaly detection: Visualize anomalies such as drops in ROP and spikes in Torque. Interactive filtering: Analyze specific depth ranges to investigate anomalies. Dynamic KPI indicators: Track changes in key parameters like Pump Pressure, Hook Load, and Standpipe Pressure. Narrative summary: Text-based insights summarizing critical findings.

📂 Dataset Details The dataset consists of the following well log measurements:

Feature Description Depth Measured depth (meters) ROP Rate of Penetration (m/hr) Hook Load Weight on the drill string (kN) Torque Rotational force on the drill bit Pump Pressure Circulating pressure in the wellbore (psi) Mud Weight Density of the drilling mud (ppg) Standpipe Pressure Pressure at the standpipe (psi) Anomaly Flag indicating anomalies (0 or 1)

🛠️ Technology Used Power BI: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards. Python (Pandas, NumPy): For generating synthetic drilling data and anomaly simulation. GitHub: For version control and collaboration.

🚀 How to Use the Dashboard Clone this repository: bash Copy Edit git clone https://github.com/Dolphinator7/Drilling-Operations-Dashboard.git Open the Power BI file to explore the dashboard. Dataset (drilling_data.csv) is included for further exploration. Analyze the dashboard for insights on drilling performance and anomaly detection.

💡 Key Insights A significant drop in ROP and corresponding spikes in Torque may indicate formation changes or equipment malfunction. Monitoring Pump Pressure and Mud Weight helps maintain well stability and prevent blowouts. Real-time anomaly detection reduces operational risks and improves efficiency.
